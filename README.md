This script allows you to safely and easily change the MAC address of a specified network interface on a Linux system. 
It includes input validation for both the network interface and the MAC address, as well as error handling to prevent accidental misconfigurations or runtime failures.

Features:
- MAC Address Validation: Ensures the new MAC address is in the correct format (e.g., XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX).
- Network Interface Validation: Verifies that the specified network interface exists on the system.
- Error Handling: Handles common issues, such as invalid inputs, nonexistent interfaces, or insufficient permissions, with clear error messages.
- User-Friendly: Guided input prompts and feedback for successful or failed operations.

Requirements:
- Linux System: This script is designed to run on Linux.
- Root Privileges: Changing a MAC address requires elevated privileges. Use sudo when running the script.
- Dependencies: The script uses ifconfig and ip commands. Ensure these utilities are installed and available on your system.
